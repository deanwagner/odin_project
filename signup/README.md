This project was created for the [Sign-Up Form assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/intermediate-html-and-css/lessons/sign-up-form) as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum. I met all the assignment objectives and then expanded on it with my own concepts to make it more functional and user-friendly.

This form uses simple HTML validation via the `pattern` attribute of the `input` element, with a little JavaScript help to make it more user-friendly. It utilizes the `:valid` and `:invalid` pseudo-elements to provide feedback to the user.

### Provided Assets

### Objectives

1. Build a page based on the Provided Assets
2. ~~“Last Name” input should be given a class of focus and styled with a blue border and a subtle box-shadow~~
3. ~~Password inputs should be given an error class~~

### Scope Creep

* Used browser-based validation with `:valid` and `:invalid` pseudo-elements instead of a class to show user feedback
* Used `:focus` pseudo-element instead of class
